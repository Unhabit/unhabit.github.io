<h1>Music</h1>
<p>My music is a big part of my life because it helps clear my mind. I mostly listen to rap. Some of my go-to artists include Don Toliver, Bryson Tiller, Gunna, Playboi Carti, Brent Faiyaz, and A Boogie wit Da Hoodie. Each artist brings something unique to my playlist, whether it’s catchy hooks, smooth vibes, or energetic beats. Their music is the perfect backdrop for different moments in my day., etc...</p>

<h1>Gaming</h1>
<p>I love playing games, especially competitive ones like CS, Valorant, Fortnite, and PvP in Minecraft. I'm drawn to the challenge and strategy involved in these games, and I enjoy pushing myself to improve and compete against other skilled players. The thrill of climbing the ranks and mastering new techniques keeps me engaged and motivated. Whether it's coordinating with a team or honing my individual skills, I find a lot of satisfaction in the competitive aspects of gaming.</p>

<h1>Travling</h1>
<p>I would love to go traveling, and one of the places I'm interested in visiting is Singapore. I've heard that it's a unique city with a mix of modern and traditional elements. It would be interesting to explore its neighborhoods, try out some local food, and see how it manages both its urban and natural spaces.</p>

<h1>Coding</h1>
<p>I enjoy coding because it helps me understand more about the tech world than I currently do. It’s a practical way to gain new knowledge and stay informed about developments in the field. Plus, it offers a sense of progression as I tackle different challenges.</p>
