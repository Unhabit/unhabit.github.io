  <h2>PC</h2>
  <p>
    I sadly don't have a picture of the PC. Me and my classmates built a PC from
    scratch. We didn't just build it we had to take repercussions before
    building it due to safety reason.

    This was a project to make a safe and private workplace physically and
    virtually.
