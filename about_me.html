<h1>Background</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Nahid Shovo. I'm originally from Bangladesh, but I was born in New York. I'm currently focused on learning Full-Stack Development, with the goal of landing a job in the high-tech industry, where I hope to build a successful career and make a lot of money. If that doesn't work out, I have a backup plan to pursue a real estate degree and get into the real estate business. I'm passionate about technology, and I'm determined to make one of these paths work for me.</p>

<h1>What Do I do in my free time</h1>
<p>I play a lot of games. The games I play on a regular is Fortnite, Minecraft, Valorant, CS2, and GTA V. </p>
<p>I also do some coding for fun, experimenting with HTML and CSS to refine my skills and work on personal projects. It helps me test out different techniques and stay sharp.</p>

<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<p>I love hanging out with my friends and always have a great time. Whether we're chilling at someone's place, playing games, grabbing food, or just having random conversations, we always manage to make the most out of every moment. Being around my friends gives me energy, and we always find a way to create fun memories together.</p>
<p>When I'm bored, I watch NileRed, TheBackyardScientist, and Mark Rober. Their videos are fun and interesting, and they always keep me entertained.</p>
