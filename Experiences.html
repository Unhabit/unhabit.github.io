<h1>SYEP</h1>
<p>The SYEP (Summer Youth Employment Program) was a dynamic initiative that offered a comprehensive learning experience. Participants engaged in creating and managing projects, which we then pitched to various companies, gaining valuable skills in project management, teamwork, and public speaking. The program also focused on financial literacy, teaching us essential strategies for budgeting, saving, investing, and understanding credit. This combination of practical project experience and financial education not only enhanced our professional capabilities but also equipped us with the knowledge to stay financially fit for the future. Overall, the SYEP experience was instrumental in building confidence, fostering independence, and preparing us for future career and financial success.</p>

<h1>WorkED Cyber Discovery</h1>
<p>WorkED Cyber was a work-based learning job that provided hands-on experience in cybersecurity. During my time there, we were taught to code a keylogger using Kali Linux, which helped us understand the fundamentals of tracking keystrokes and potential vulnerabilities in systems. Additionally, we gained in-depth knowledge about how firewalls are configured and protected, learning the intricacies of different types of firewalls and their role in network security. The program also covered various aspects of cybersecurity best practices, including threat detection, ethical hacking, and incident response. This practical experience was invaluable in understanding the complexities of cybersecurity and the importance of robust defense mechanisms.</p>

<h1>WorkED Advanced Cyber</h1>
<p>We learned how to harvest credentials using Kali Linux. This involved creating a phishing site designed to capture the information that users input. Additionally, we delved into password auditing by manipulating password data. Specifically, we worked with the /etc/shadow file to test password security. This process included creating a new user and configuring it to use our own passwords to assess their strength.</p>

<h1>Cyber Apprentices Via WorkED Program </h1>
<p>We completed projects based on real-world cybersecurity events, delving into actual incidents, attacker tactics, and organizational responses. This hands-on approach helped us enhance our practical understanding and application of cybersecurity principles. As part of our coursework, we conducted a detailed incident report on the CrowdStrike outage. This involved analyzing the root causes of the outage, assessing the impact on affected systems, and researching mitigation strategies. We then developed recommendations on how to prevent similar outages in the future, including improvements to system redundancy, response protocols, and incident detection mechanisms. This exercise not only honed our analytical skills but also provided valuable insights into proactive cybersecurity management.</p>
